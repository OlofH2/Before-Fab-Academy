I started working as the manager for [Fab Lab Austurland](https://www.fablabs.io/labs/fablabausturland) in the beginning of january 2024 and will be attending Fab Academy to fulfill my contract with my employer, [Verkmenntaskóli Austurlands](https://www.va.is/), which is a small Secondary school in Neskaupstaður, in the east of Iceland.
