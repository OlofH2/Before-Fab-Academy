#Final project

##The search for an idea

In the beginning I had so many starting points to choose from but it was quite difficult to see how they would look as a final project. These were the first ones:

* Something that acts as a living being:
    - A plant that raises her leaves in daylight and loweres them at night.
    - An animal form that rises up at certain time and kneels after some time.
    - An animal that swims/moves in slow movements (Greenland shark?)

* A light hanging from the ceiling with lights that can be controlled.
    - Laser cut forms.
