**Compressing photos using Image Magick**

I downloaded the program from this [site](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)
When Image Magick has been downloaded and set up it doesn´t appear as an app/program that you can open in your computer but you can use it as a terminal. I opened a folder with my documentation photos and wrote "cmd" in the explorer window. Then a window for a terminal popped up.

When compressing photos, I set the width in pixels.......


**Compressing videos using FFmpeg**

This program was downloaded from this [site](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) but I had to download another program called [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to be able to unzip the FFmpeg download. Just like Image Magick, FFmpeg is also used in a terminal. When compressing videos, I set the height in pixels.[Svavar Konráðsson](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/isafjordur/students/svavar-konradsson/index.html) recommended 360 pixels in height. 

A code to compress to compress the final project video in Fab Academy can be found on the [Fab Academy 2024 site](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/video.html). In this code the resolution is higher.
