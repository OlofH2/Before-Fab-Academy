Getting and setting up programs

To prepare the creation of this website and documentation of the assignments it was necessary to install a few programs:


[Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* On this Python website Python is explained as a language for programming that works fast and is effective in integrating systems. On their [site](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) you can find directions for beginners.
Ath...PIP

[GitHub](https://github.com/)
* In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc) GitHub is explained in a fun way. You can use GitHub to code and store data, both on your own or in collaboration with others. I had signed up in GitHub a few months ago so I had an account but when I installed Visual Studio Code I had to connect VSC to my GitHub account.

[Visual Studio Code]https://code.visualstudio.com/()
* According to their website, in VS Code you can code in different programming languages, f.ex. HTML, Python, Json, Javascript, YAML and create Markdown and that is exactly what I needed to do when creating my website. One more thing; it is necessary to close VS Code after installing programs or adding extensions and then open it again to begin working.

[GitHub Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)
* GitHub Graph can be used as an extension in Visual Studio Code. When you click on it you can see all commits in a pictorial tree/timeline. You can travel between changes in files and restore old commits if necessesary. I like the picturesque look of all the actions because it helps getting a good overview of what has been done.

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
* Material for MkDocs is a site generator that can build HTML sites and it works well with GitHub and Visual Studio Code. You can choose between different themes and add plugins. I like the clear instructions that can be found on their [website](https://www.mkdocs.org/). A great help for beginners like me. 


* One helpful note: When switching between programs in your computer you can press ALT + TAB
