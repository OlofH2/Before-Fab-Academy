#Getting and setting up programs

###To prepare the creation of this website and documentation of the assignments it was necessary to install a few programs:

###[GitHub](https://github.com/)
* In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc) video GitHub is explained in a fun way. You can use GitHub to code and store data, both on your own or in collaboration with others. 

###[Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

###[Visual Studio Code]https://code.visualstudio.com/()

###[GitHub Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)

###[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
* Material for MkDocs is a site generator that can build HTML sites and it works well with GitHub and Visual Studio Code. You can choose between different themes and add plugins. I like the clear instructions that can be found on their [website](https://www.mkdocs.org/). A great help for beginners like me.
