    This [tutorial](hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8Nw69Vn5o&t=110s) shows how you can make logos with custom text treatment in Inkscape.

I clicket on the text icon in Inkscape and chose a font. By holding **CTRL** and **SHIFT** I could scale the size and still keep the same proportions. Then I converted the text to path by choosing **Path** and then **Object to path**. After that I clicked on **Object** and **Ungroup**. 

I clicked on **Object** and **Fill and stroke**. There I changed the **Opacity** from 100 to 50. That way the letters were a little bit transparent and I could see them all when they overlapped each other. By holding **CTRL** while moving a letter, the letter was locked on the horizontal axis when moving them around. Then I could select more than one letter by holding **SHIFT** while clicking on all letters I wanted to select when moving multiple letters at the same time.
