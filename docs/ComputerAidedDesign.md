##Designing a logo


!!!Info "Designing a logo in Inkscape"
  
    This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8Nw69Vn5o) shows how you can make logos with custom text treatment in Inkscape.

I decided to use my first name when designing my logo. I clicked on the text icon in Inkscape and chose a font. By holding **CTRL** and **SHIFT** I could scale the size and still keep the same proportions. Then I converted the text to path by choosing **Path** and then **Object to path**. After that I clicked on **Object** and **Ungroup**. 

I clicked on **Object** and **Fill and stroke**. There I changed the **Opacity** from 100 to 50. That way the letters were a little bit transparent and I could see them all when they overlapped each other. By holding **CTRL** while moving a letter, the letter was locked on the horizontal axis when moving them around. Then I could select more than one letter by holding **SHIFT** while clicking on all letters I wanted to select when moving multiple letters at the same time.

By selecting one letter and clicking on **CTRL** and **D** I duplicated the letter. Then I changed the color of the letter by clicking on a color in the color palette at the bottom of the screen. I went to **Path** and **Path effects**. Then I clicked on the arrow to the right on the screen, below the **Path effects** text and chose **Offset**. Then I could use the **plus symbol** to increase the offset until I was happy with the size. After that I held the **Shift** button and clicked on the letter beside it. Then I chose **Path** and **Difference**. This is the outcome:

I wasn't really happy with the outcome, so I kept on trying different ways. I used the **Impact** font and arranged my name in a rectangle.

Then I added a pink rectangle to the logo.

I used the **Typographica** font that I found on the website [DaFont.com](https://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=typographica), resized some letters and arranged them in a fun way to make this logo:

    This looks like an emoji! I think it would be fun to learn how to use **Blender** to change this logo to an emoji. I could call it **Baffled face**, expressing the feeling that can come over people when learning something new in Fab Academy.

Then I tested how it would look with the **ComicSans** font:

I found the font **Pricedown** on [DaFont.com](https://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=pricedown), stretched some lines and created an outline.
