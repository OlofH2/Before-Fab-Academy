    This [tutorial](hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8Nw69Vn5o&t=110s) shows how you can make logos with custom text treatment in Inkscape.

I clicket on the text icon in Inkscape and chose a font. By holding **CTRL** and **SHIFT** I could scale the size and still keep the same proportions. Then I converted the text to path by choosing **Path** and then **Object to path**. After that I clicked on **Object** and **Ungroup**. 

I clicked on **Object** and **Fill and stroke**. There I changed the **Opacity** from 100 to 50. That way the letters were a little bit transparent and I could see them all when they overlapped each other. By holding **CTRL** while moving a letter, the letter was locked on the horizontal axis when moving them around. Then I could select more than one letter by holding **SHIFT** while clicking on all letters I wanted to select when moving multiple letters at the same time.

By selecting one letter and clicking on **CTRL** and **D** I duplicated the letter. Then I changed the color of the letter by clicking on a color in the color palette at the bottom of the screen. I went to **Path** and **Path effects**. Then I clicked on the arrow to the right on the screen, below the **Path effects** text and chose **Offset**. Then I could use the **plus symbol** to increase the offset until I was happy with the size. Then I used the **Bezier pen** to draw a circle around the area where I wanted to make the offset remove a part of the letter beside it. I clicked on this area, held **Shift** down and clicked on the rest of the letter. Then I went to **Path** and **Intersection**. After that I held the **Shift** button again and clicked on the letter beside it. Then I chose **Path** and **Difference**.
