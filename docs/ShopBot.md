CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control

Router bits and end-mills

Raster/bitmap vs. vector

"Allow precise and repetitive control"

Speed: ips (inches per second)
Can cut 2D (x and y) and we create 2D toolpath

2.5D is usually used when making signs, so I would compare it to making a relief. Router travels by x and y axis and only uses the z-axis to go in and out of toolpaths. To do a 3D work you would have to design a 3D model.

I used the program [VCarve pro](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to design my sign. 

I began by filling in the size of the material I wanted to use. I wrote 38cm x 38cm. It is very important to always measure the thickness of the material because it can vary. I set the thickness to .............

I **set the xy origin position to bottom left** and made sure that **Use origin offset was NOT chosen**. 
I tested how to draw a perfect rectangle by choosing the rectangle and holding the **Control** button when clicking and drawing with the mouse. I deleted it and drew an ellipse. Then I wrote a text by clicking on the big T. When the text was on the plate I resized it by using the resizing arrow, clicked on the text and dragged one corner to make it smaller. By holding the **Shift** key whilst doing that it centered and rezised it all.
