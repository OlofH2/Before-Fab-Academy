CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control

Router bits and end-mills

Raster/bitmap vs. vector

"Allow precise and repetitive control"

Speed: ips (inches per second)
Can cut 2D (x and y) and we create 2D toolpath

2.5D is usually used when making signs, so I would compare it to making a relief. Router travels by x and y axis and only uses the z-axis to go in and out of toolpaths. To do a 3D work you would have to design a 3D model.
