
The creation of a website

Understanding HTML+Javascript
The first assignment was to copy a code from..... and paste it into a NotePad. By saving the NotePad file as a HTML file it opens up as a webpage when doubleclicked on. This helped me to understand how HTML and Javascript work.

Learning about CSS
The next step was to learn about CSS, or Cascade Style Sheet, and how we can use CSS to control the way our HTML code appears, f.ex. the colour of elements, where text is situated and which fonts to use. On this page [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) we could find explanations on CSS.

Autosave in VS Code

Compressing photos and videos
In the beginning of my documentation I used the Snipping Tool ![Snipping Tool]

###Since the size of all images was around 15-50kb I thought that they would be conveniently small for my website, and I decided to load them all up at the same time. When I checked out the website I saw that they were too big.

Loads of mistakes

One of the mistakes I made when creating this site was to make two yaml files in my Actions folder. Svavar pointed this out to me and I deleted one blank yaml file.

I knew that the number of hashtags in front of a sentence or a word controlled which type of heading was used and I thougt that if I used one hashtag in front of the headline I should use two hashtags in front of text that I wanted to be bigger than normal text. What I did not know was that the hashtags I was using also made the text appear in the Table of content. Svavar saw this and he let me know so that I could fix this.
