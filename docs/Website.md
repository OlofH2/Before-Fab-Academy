###Understanding HTML+Javascript
####The first assignment was to copy a code from..... and paste it into a NotePad. By saving the NotePad file as a HTML file it opens up as a webpage when doubleclicked on. This helped me to understand how HTML and Javascript work.

###Learning about CSS
####The next step was to learn about CSS, or Cascade Style Sheet, and how we can use CSS to control the way our HTML code appears, f.ex. the colour of elements, where text is situated and which fonts to use. On this page [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) we could find explanations on CSS.




##Cloning a repository


##Autosave in VS Code
###It is possible to turn on Autosave in VS Code and I find that helpful because when I am documenting my changes appear almost instantly on my website and I can check out regurlarly how things look.

##Compressing photos and videos
###In the beginning of my documentation I used the Snipping Tool ![Snipping Tool]
(img/Snipping_tool_b.jpg)
###Since the size of all images was around 15-50kb I thought that they would be conveniently small for my website, and I decided to load them all up at the same time. When I checked out the website I saw that they were too big. I had to resize them again to get the preferred size and this time I adjusted the pixel size.

##Loads of mistakes

####One of the mistakes I made when creating this site was to make two yaml files in my Actions folder. Svavar pointed this out to me and I deleted one blank yaml file.
